## The site

This site is a fork of the Netlify-cms-gatsby-starter blog. Fork it yourself at [gituhub](https://github.com). It's built on the JAMstack which means that the site is static.


## Me 

I went to university to become a Mechancal Engineer because at school I liked to use the lathe. To my great suprise, there was't much oppurtunity to play with lathes in an engineering degree. It was all maths. To avoid having to do as much maths I taught myself programming. First in matlab and later in Python and R.

Since then I have worked on mathematical models, SCADA thats system control and data aquistions systems, and data-science applications for companies like Airbus and Rolls-Royce.

Outside of work I like, brewing beer, building bikes and bodging building work.
