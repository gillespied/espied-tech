In very unoriginal style, the first post here will be how I built this site. Its built with gatsby a static site generator in react. I forked the [repo from netlify](#) as it was already bundled with a few modules I wanted to use. I cloned it and ran `npm install` then started the development server with `gatsby develop`.
