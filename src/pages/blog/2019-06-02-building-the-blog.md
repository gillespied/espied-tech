Hello and welcome to the site. I'm going to use this blog to post about the stuff that I'm working on. It'll probably be mostly data-science stuff. While I have done a lot of work in this area, it has all been closed source. Rolls-Royce are particularly sensitive about sharing anything. I think in part due to export control worries. This is problematic when I'm trying to find work as it's difficult to demonstrate ability. 

Over time I plan to use this site, and my  github, as my portfolio. You can check out [my github](https://github.com/gillespied) if you are interested. It hasn't got much there at the moment, but does include the source code for this site. I'll be posting about how I built it soon.
